                  <h5>Functional Requirements:</h5>
                  <li>1. User will provide long url and should get short url back</li>
                  <li>2. User will access short url link and should be redirected to long url</li>
                  <li>3. Short link will get expire in some time so user should be able to specify expiration time</li>
                  <li>4. User can pick alias for short url if he want</li>
                  <br>
                  <p>Example: <br>
                      Long url => https://www.virendrasinghrathore24.com <br>
                      Short Url => http://tinyurl.com/ang58a</p>
                  <br>
                  <h5>Non Functional Requirements:</h5>
                  <li>1. Highly Available</li>
                  <li>2. Minimum latency for url redirection</li>
                  <br>
                  <h5>Capacity Estimation:</h5>
                  <p>TODO</p>
                  <br>
                  <h5>APIs:</h5>
                  <li>1. createUrl(dev_key, longurl, custom_alias = None, expire_date = None) and returns shorturl as string format</li>
                  <li>2. deleteUrl(dev_key, shorturl) and returns success message for deletion</li>
                  <li>3. accessUrl(dev_key, shorturl)</li>
                  <br>
                  <h5>Database Design:</h5>
                  <p>Few observations: <br> </p>
                     <li>We need to store billions of records</li>
                  <li>Each object is small (lees than 1KB)</li>
                  <li>Ready heavy service</li>
                  <li>There are no relationship between records - other than storing which user created url</li>
                  <br>
                  <h6>Key Generation Service (KGS):</h6>
                  <p>We can have a standalone Key Generation Service (KGS) that generates random six
                     letter strings beforehand and stores them in a database (let’s call it key-DB).
                      Whenever we want to shorten a URL, we will just take one of the already-generated keys and use it.
                      This approach will make things quite simple and fast. Not only are
                        we not encoding the URL, but we won’t have to worry about duplications or
                        collisions. KGS will make sure all the keys inserted into key-DB are unique.
                  </p>
                  <p><strong>Can concurrency cause problems? </strong> As soon as a key is used, it should be marked
                    in the database to ensure it doesn’t get used again. If there are multiple servers
                    reading keys concurrently, we might get a scenario where two or more servers try to
                      read the same key from the database. How can we solve this concurrency problem?</p>
                  <p>Servers can use KGS to read/mark keys in the database. KGS can use two tables to
                     store keys: one for keys that are not used yet, and one for all the used keys. As soon
                     as KGS gives keys to one of the servers, it can move them to the used keys table. KGS
                      can always keep some keys in memory so that it can quickly provide them whenever
                    a server needs them.</p>
                  <p><strong>Isn’t KGS a single point of failure? </strong> Yes, it is. To solve this, we can have a standby
                     replica of KGS. Whenever the primary server dies, the standby server can take over to generate and provide keys.</p>
