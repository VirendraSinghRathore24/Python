                  <p>Python deletes unwanted objects automatically to free the memory space.
                      The process by which Python periodically frees and
                      reclaims blocks of memory that no longer are in use is called Garbage Collection.<br></p>
                <p>In python memory allocation and deallocation happens automatically, user does not worry about memory management.
                <br>
                    Why memory release needed:
                    <li>Forgetting to free your memory. If you don’t free your memory when you’re done using it,
                  it can result in memory leaks. This can lead to your program using too much memory over time.
                  For long-running applications, this can cause serious problems.</li><br>
                  <li>Freeing your memory too soon. The second type of problem consists of freeing
                      your memory while it’s still in use. This can cause your program to crash
                      if it tries to access a value in memory that doesn’t exist,
                      or it can corrupt your data. A variable that refers to memory
                      that has been freed is called a dangling pointer.</li>
                  <br>
                Python uses two strategies for memory allocation: </p>
                  <li>Reference counting</li>
                  <li>Garbage collection</li>
                    <h4><br>Reference counting:</h4>
                  <p>Reference counting works by counting the number of times an object is referenced by other objects in the system.
                      When references to an object are removed, the reference count for an object is decremented.
                      When the reference count becomes zero, the object is deallocated<br></p>
                  <p>a = 10 # line 1<br>
                      # Some code # line 2<br><br>
                      here at line 1 => reference count of variable a is incremented to 1<br>
                      In line 2 its reference count becomes zero as it is dereferenced.
                      So garbage collector deallocates the object<br>
                  </p>
                    <p>Reference count will not work if there is a reference cycle exists.</p>
                  <p>A reference cycle is created when there is no way the reference count of the object can reach to zero.
                      The easiest way to create a reference cycle is to create an object which refers to itself as in the example below:<br></p>

                  </div>
                    <p><br>Because create_cycle() creates an object x which refers to itself,
                        the object x will not automatically be freed when the function returns.
                        This will cause the memory that x is using to be held onto until
                        the Python garbage collector is invoked.</p>

                  <p><br>Assigning del x => delete variable => invoke garbage collection</p>
